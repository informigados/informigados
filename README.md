# 👋 Welcome!

I'm Alex Brito, a Brazilian Web Developer with over 15 years of experience building reliable, scalable, and performance-driven digital solutions.

My work sits at the intersection of engineering, education, and strategic thinking. I don’t just build systems — I design solutions that solve real problems with clarity and long-term vision.

## 🚀 What I Do

- Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, React, Tailwind, WordPress)
- Systems Architecture & Integrations
- Performance Optimization
- Technical Consulting
- Open-source and collaborative projects

## 🎓 Beyond Code

I am also a Technology and Philosophy professor.  
Teaching keeps my thinking sharp. Philosophy keeps my engineering grounded.

I believe technology without reflection becomes noise — and reflection without action becomes theory.

I work in both worlds.

## 🧠 Core Principles

- Clean, maintainable code
- Performance as a feature
- Simplicity over complexity
- Long-term thinking over shortcuts
- Technology that actually solves problems
